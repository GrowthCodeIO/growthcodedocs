# GrowthCode Overview

### Introduction to GrowthCode

GrowthCode believes that the independent members of the online advertising ecosystem stand to gain significant leverage and create new revenue streams in the transition to first-party data as the primary currency of advertising. We exist to empower publishers, vendors, and advertisers to reach the full economic potential of this transition.

These resources will help you better understand and deploy GrowthCode to power your monetization and harness the full potential of your first-party data to maximize revenue generation through your revenue channels.
