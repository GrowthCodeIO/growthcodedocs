# GrowthCode Installation Overview

## <mark style="color:orange;">GrowthCode Addressability Management Platform Setup Guide</mark>

GrowthCode provides an integrated service that builds a unique identity graph of your users, ingests events, tracks audience behavior, creates data segments, and then seamlessly delivers this data to programmatic partners to increase monetization.\
\
GrowthCode connects first, second, and third-party data directly to your programmatic channels.  As an independent platform, GrowthCode enables publishers and their approved technology partners to own their data, providing an unbiased and truthful view of performance with a flexible data science environment to optimize audience segmentation, media spend, resource allocation, and attribution.

#### <mark style="color:orange;">The GrowthCode Identity Graph provides</mark>

* A single view of the customer with a cookieless identifier&#x20;
* Customer segmentation based upon IAB and custom taxonomies
* A match table across common universal IDs (Fabrick, Panorama, ID5, etc.)
* Integration with SSPs, DSPs, and DMPs to create new revenue streams
* Reporting to provide a 360-degree view on identity activity and graph health

## <mark style="color:orange;">Trust, Transparency, and Neutrality</mark>

GrowthCode is a neutral and unbiased partner providing data, connectivity, and infrastructure necessary to leverage all available data signals. GrowthCode does not sell media. This neutral position allows for broad integration across all approved parties. GrowthCode does not own your data. We provide a framework for accessing this data and the infrastructure to link this data with partners who will increase monetization.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:orange;">How does GrowthCode’s prebid universal ID module (UIM) work?</mark>

1. Prebid lists User ID providers and their corresponding sub-modules
2. Publishers decide which Universal Identity Modules to add to their header bidding package
3. GrowthCode manages the installation of UIM per the direction of the publisher
4. Upon page-load, the UIM is invoked and the data is stored according to the publisher’s settings
5. Prebid passes the appropriate consent string to all sub-modules

### <mark style="color:orange;">Requirements</mark>

* Prebid Installed (Version 7 or greater)
* A valid unique ID for each visitor to your site is required (most publishers use [ShareIdID User Module in Prebid](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/modules/userid-submodules/growthcode.html)) – if not available, GrowthCode will create this unique ID
* A valid Partner ID is required for the Growth Code UIM to work correctly. A Partner ID is unique to each publisher and must be initially generated by GrowthCode. Your Partner will be sent separately during the setup process.&#x20;
* GrowthCode Sync Code must be installed on all pages. (including your newsletter signup pages)
  * Pass your unique Publisher I
  * Pass any appropriate privacy strings (TCF EU v2, TCF CA v1 and CCPA/USPrivacy)

### <mark style="color:orange;">Bid Enrichment</mark>

Many demand partners will increase the value of their bids if there is additional Universal IDs (UIDs) added to the bid request.  GrowthCode will automatically add these Universal IDs based upon the unique requirements of the SSP or DSP.  Once the GC ID is active, these UIDs will be automatically added into the bid request through the GrowthCode RTD module.  Additional UIDs will be added as they prove valuable.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:orange;">First Party Syncing</mark>

In addition to bid decoration, some SSPs and DSPs allow publishers to sync their first-party data (typically the Hashed Email - HEM) with the partner’s proprietary ID Graph. This allows the SSP or DSP to pay more for an impression because they can better identify your users. This process is called tokenization. Currently, three SSPs provide this service. Please provide the following to support these services:

* Your Amazon Publisher Services (APS) Id (If using)
* Your Epsilon Publisher Id (If using)
* Criteo Id (If using)

If you are not currently integrated with these SSP’s GrowthCode can help with introductions. If you are integrated, please provide the Publisher ID provided to you by the associated SSP.&#x20;

### <mark style="color:orange;">Requirements: minimum configuration</mark>

* Prebid Installed (Version 8 or greater)
* A valid unique ID for each visitor to your site is required (most publishers use [ShareIdID User Module in Prebid](https://docs.prebid.org/dev-docs/modules/userid-submodules/growthcode.html)) – if not available, GrowthCode will create this unique ID

#### <mark style="color:orange;">Bid Enrichment</mark>

GrowthCode automatically adds [Universal IDs ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YL1awRN7StON-lzp8VAcB4U83aUTHXwt9uYxPrKhtk8/edit?usp=sharing)to bid requests based on SSP or DSP requirements, optimizing bid responses. As the GC ID activates, these UIDs are seamlessly incorporated into bid requests through the pubProvidedId module. Continuous assessment ensures valuable UIDs are retained for optimal results.
